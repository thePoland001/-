# About 

Hi, I'm Josh – a Systems Engineering and Computer Science student with a strong passion for aerospace and technology. I'm currently pursuing a BSc in Industrial & Systems Engineering concurrently with a Master's in Computer Science from CU Boulder.

I'm fascinated by the intersection of systems engineering and software, with a long-term goal of working in the private spaceflight industry. I’m currently preparing for a career in engineering or product management, aiming to combine technical expertise with strategic leadership to drive complex projects to success.
